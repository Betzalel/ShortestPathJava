ToDo List for Project
---------------------

Djikstra's Algorithm
	- Need to create the class that will conduct the algorithm
GUI Design
	- Need to meet and figure out how we want the GUI to look like
	- I would like a sphere with the cities on it like a globe
		o not sure how hard that will be...
GUI Implementation
	- Once designed, we need to make it happen
UML Diagrams
	- UML for all classes and groups of classes
JavaDocs
	- Each class must have a JavaDoc associated with it.
	- I will JavaDoc the classes I have added.
	- Don't worry about JavaDocing test classes as these will not be kept.
